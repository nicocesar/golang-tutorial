# golang-tutorial

This is a brief tutorial I created for a couple friends to show how to do some stuff in Go and Ethereum.

# Milestones

1. Create the environment to compile/execute in docker
1. Use abigen to compile a contract into a Go 
1. Create an account in Infura and read logs from it
1. Using the abi created, process the logs into something more readeable print it out on screen.

# Structure

* Each milestone will be a separate branch (named milestone-nnn-xxxxxxx) so you can compare each step with a diff
* main branch will have the "final" code.
