# golang-tutorial

This is a brief tutorial I created for a couple friends to show how to do some stuff in Go and Ethereum.

# Milestones

1. Create the environment to compile/execute in docker
1. Use abigen to compile an ERC20 contract into a Go 
1. Create an account in Infura and read information from the ERC20 token
1. Compile a UniswapV3 Pool and read swap() logs from it
1. Process the logs into something more readeable print it out on screen.

# Structure

* Each milestone will be a separate branch (named milestone-nnn-xxxxxxx) so you can compare each step with a diff
* main branch will have the "final" code.
